## **Analysis Scenario**

Imagine our Head of Performance Marketing sends you an email:

*I need to understand where to invest more money. I'm curious if you can help me make a decision based on your findings. Do you think it's ios or android?*

*Aside from that I'm also curious if there's specific marketing channels we should be aiming for to get better results? I'm currently thinking that the channel with ID 4 looks promising. What are your thoughts? Looking further into the data at hand it looks like UK (United Kingdom) would be a good investment. Do you agree?*

*It would be great if you can present your findings and suggestions next week at the weekly marketing staff meeting.*

*Thanks, Ben*
